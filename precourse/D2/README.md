# Epicode-Pre-Corso-Es-2
This is the second exercise of the Epicode's pre-course
As the previous one, even this exercise is part of the Epicode's bootcamp pre-course.
It's just an emulation of a streaming provider built in HTML and with a little CSS directly in the HTML tags.
Basically it consists in a registration form filled with input tag and the usage of a table.

Please note that i'm a complete noobie, this is one of the first time i'm facing with coding, but i'm here to learn.
