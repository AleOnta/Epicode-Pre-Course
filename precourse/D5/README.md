# Epicode-Pre-Course-Es-5
 This is the fifth and last exercise of the Epicode's bootcamp pre-course

In this exercise the task was to recreate an HTML structure of Youtube, using the Flexbox property.
I'm happy / fine with the final result i've came up with, but i know i could have done many things differently, such as giving more responsivness to the entire code.
Anyway i'll keep make practice with these properties and look forward to get started with the coding bootcamp.

PS -> the fourth (4) exercise of the Epicode's bootcamp pre-course was to make practice using flexbox property using: https://flexboxfroggy.com/ 
This is why in my repositories there's a jump between exercise #3 and #5.

Please note that i'm a complete noobie, this is one of the first time i'm facing with coding, but i'm here to learn.
