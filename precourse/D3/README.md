# Epicode-Pre-Course-Es-3
 This is the third exercise of the Epicode's bootcamp pre-course

In this exercise i've started to use a separated file for the CSS instructions, as i learned that's the normal procedure.
The repository contain a series of HTML files that represents the differents pages of the 'website' i come up with.
I tried to use a single CSS file (style3.css) to set the istructions for all the HTML pages, and it worked out okay i think.
The real issue with this exercise, for me, were the background images; and that's because i'm still not confident with them and also because the height of the had to be set at 500px, but i was able to find only images of bigger height.

Please note that i'm a complete noobie, this is one of the first time i'm facing with coding, but i'm here to learn.
