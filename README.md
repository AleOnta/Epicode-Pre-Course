# Epicode-Pre-Course
This is a re-upload of the epicode's pre-course exercises.

I had to upload again these exercise due to a wrong setup made for the older versions on my PC, also, having 4 differenrs repositories each one for a basic exercise,
wasn't the best idea.
This 4 exercises are part of the epicode's pre-course, that means these are exercises i made on my own before starting the Full-Stack Course i'm currently following.
It was a nice method to make practice and understand the basics of the markup languages, and it has been helpful to me to comprehend that this was the right path for me.
